I am a junior in ECE. I just transferred here from UIUC in Illinois. I am the member of the IEEE-HKN (an ECE honor society). My main interests are signal processing and multimedia. I used to play badminton and swim, but now become much more indoor-orientated. I love reading books about philosophy and history on the free time, and I am also a member of the drama club.
