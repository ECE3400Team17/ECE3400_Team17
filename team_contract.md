# Team Contract

## Team Procedures
Members of the team should be aware of the dates and times for each meeting and notify the group when they will be late/absent. Our weekly meeting and designated workplace will be: 

* Friday 11:15am - 12:05pm  at Kimball Hall B11 
* Study rooms in Olin, Uris, or Rhodes if whiteboard and projector are needed.

Team members will decide on an agenda to be announced at least 2 days before the following meeting. Team members will be notified first in person, and then reminded via Messenger group chat. During each meeting, the team leader will be responsible for following the agenda. We will check in with each other via the online Messenger every 2 days to ensure that everybody is on track.

We will make team decisions via group voting to make sure that everyone has an equal say. The decision/plan with majority vote would be the one that the group implements.

#### Record of meeting:
For each meeting, we will have one person in the team record the content of the meeting. The record will be used as a reference for the team to update the webpage with the new project progress of the week.  

Our main mode of communication is via the Facebook/Messenger group chat. Timely responses are expected; the delay time should depend on the urgency of the matter. 

## Team Expectations

### Work Quality: 
We will agree on a realistic level of quality for team website updates, individual work, etc. Peer reviews and team support are important.

The team will decide which individuals/sub-teams will work on different parts, and set their deadlines accordingly. The individual/sub-team should submit their work 2 hours prior to their designated due date so that the entire team can review the material. 

The team will assign each member a task/section to work on, but most of the work will be a collaborative effort.

### Team Participation:

Members should speak up if they require help. We will try to balance the distribution of heavy and light workloads over the course of the semester. Everyone should try their best! It is okay to struggle during a particularly difficult week, but make sure to contribute as much as you can in the following weeks. Prelims suck, after all.

During team meetings, every member should be allowed to talk and share ideas/concerns about the project and their progress. For task maintenance, we will use an Excel sheet to keep track of everyone’s assignments.

Please reach out to the rest of the group if you have any problems or are confused. Nobody is expected to know everything. The team leader can help coordinate other members to resolve the issue.
