# Team Contract


Team Procedures
Members of the team should be aware the dates and times of all meetings and and notify the group when they will be late/absent. Our weekly meeting and designated workplace will be: 

Friday 11:15am - 12:05pm Â at Kimball Hall B11 / study room in Olin or Uris if whiteboard and projector are needed.

Team members will decide on an agenda to be announced 2 days before the following meeting. Team members will be notified first in person, and then reminded via the Messenger group chat. During each meeting, the team leader will be responsible for following the agenda. We will check in with each other via the online Messenger every 2 days to ensure that everybody is on track.
