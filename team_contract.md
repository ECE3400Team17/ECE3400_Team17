# Team Contract

## Team Procedures
Members of the team should be aware of the dates and times for each meeting and notify the group when they will be late/absent. Our weekly meeting and designated workplace will be: 

* Friday 11:15am - 12:05pm in Kimball Hall B11 
* Friday 1:25pm - 4:25pm in Phillips 4th Floor Lab
* Sunday 10:00am : Duff. (team catch-up)
* Study rooms in Olin, Uris, or Rhodes if whiteboard and projector are needed.

Team members will decide on an agenda to be announced atleast 10 hours before the following meeting. Team members will be notified first in person, and then reminded via Messenger group chat. During each meeting, the team leader will be responsible for following the agenda. We will check in with each other via the online Messenger every 2 days to ensure that everybody is on track.

We plan to submitt each of our Lab report parts by 3:00 pm Thursday, this will provide and buffer and ample time to update the website.

We will make team decisions via group voting to make sure that everyone has an equal say. The decision/plan with majority vote would be the one that the group implements.

#### Record of meeting:
For each meeting, we will have one person in the team record the content of the meeting. The record will be used as a reference for the team to update the webpage with the new project progress of the week.  

Our main mode of communication is via the Facebook/Messenger group chat. Timely responses are expected (within 3hours closer to deadlines and 6 hours otherwise, not at 4am); the delay time should depend on the urgency of the matter. 

## Team Expectations

### Work Quality: 
We will agree on a realistic level of quality for team website updates, individual work, etc. Peer reviews and team support are important.

The team will decide which individuals/sub-teams will work on different parts, and set their deadlines accordingly. The individual/sub-team should submit their work 2 hours prior to their designated due date so that the entire team can review the material. 

The team will assign each member a task/section to work on, but most of the work will be a collaborative effort.

### Team Participation:

Members should speak up if they require help. We will try to balance the distribution of heavy and light workloads over the course of the semester. Everyone should try their best! It is okay to struggle during a particularly difficult week, but make sure to contribute as much as you can in the following weeks. Prelims suck, after all.

During team meetings, every member should be allowed to talk and share ideas/concerns about the project and their progress. For task maintenance, we will use an Excel sheet to keep track of everyone’s assignments.

Please reach out to the rest of the group if you have any problems or are confused. Nobody is expected to know everything. The team leader can help coordinate other members to resolve the issue.

## Personal Accountability

All members are expected to attend meetings punctually and participate during each session. Attendance is mandatory unless there is an unavoidable conflict or a valid excuse that is announced to the team beforehand.

Each member should complete his/her task with special attention to quality and timeliness. You are responsible for fulfilling team assignments and making deadlines. If you cannot complete your work in time, be sure to let the group know well before the due date. 

Team members should communicate regularly via the established Messenger chat and respond in a reasonably prompt manner. Keep track of project updates via the Google Drive folder or the Github project.

Should you happen to miss a meeting, follow up with the group to catch up. The team members present in the meeting are also responsible for helping each other stay updated.

### Consequences for failing to abide by the above policies: 

The group as a whole should address any individual who fails to abide by the above policies for any reason to make sure that:

a) they are on the same page

b) they brought the snacks

c) they will diligently catch up on the work and continue contributing on time for the team.

Should any heinous infractions of these very simple guidelines continue, the team will go to a TA/Kirstin.

## Team Leadership

Every person on the team will be assigned a leadership role for at least two weeks. The role of the leader will be to organize meetings and ensure that work is submitted in a timely fashion.
