# Meeting Minutes

## December 2, 2017:

### Note Taker: Stephanie Lin

**Overall Goals:** NEED TO FINISH ROBOT

**Task delegation:**

- Thinesiya: Maze algorithm, sending done signal, sending packets in a less cluttered way to speed up maze traversal, make amplifiers for treasure detection because we only have one.
- Stephanie: Formatting packets for base station, keeping track of elements in an array, incorporating SPI code into the base station code.
- Alan: Arduino to FPGA communication (SPI)
- Yijia: VGA display
- Mira: Make circuit for start button, treasure detection

## November 27, 2017:

### Note Taker: Stephanie Lin

**Overall Goals:** Finish the robot!!!! Need to finish display. Catch up on things we didn't quite complete in time for Milestone 4.

**Problems:** We...dropped the robot, oh no! One of the wheels probably needs to be recalibrated; it continues turning even when nothing is happening. 

## November 15, 2017:

### Note Taker: Stephanie Lin

**Overall Goals:** Next milestone

**Activity summary:** Focused on putting the robot together with our new parts, including the Arduino Mega.

**Problems:** The robot isn't moving anymore??? Strange. Need to fix.

## November 3, 2017:

### Note Taker: Stephanie Lin

We have a few teammates who will not be present, so this will be about dividing work amongst the rest of us.

**Overall Goals:** Catching up and fixing components. Finish milestone 3.

- Peter: FPGA display
- Yijia, Stephanie: Radio
- Alan: SPI, connecting radio info to the FPGA board
- Mira & Thinesiya: Assisting everyone remotely because they'll be away. Thinesiya will ensure that the lab report is comprehensive.

## October 23rd, 2017:

### Note Taker: Stephanie Lin

Gathered in Duffield during the week to discuss how we would divide our next tasks.

**Overall Goals:** Create a functional robot that moves, follows the wall, detects lines.
(Extra: if there's time, integrate algorithms into a merged file, do radio communications) 

- Peter: Build robot, help with communication
- Alan & Yijia: Finish Radio, communications test
- Thinesiya: Work on maze algorithm, test algorithm 
- Stephanie: Line and wall sensor calibration, motor code
- Mira: Build robot, motor code

* We also complied a [list](https://docs.google.com/a/cornell.edu/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSTQp0IG7Iwsusa700l3QNW1hzmw4rRXlBD25loEtV3EYwyXNp-MmKyH7rM3DGJ_d92AQiNVMZ2jJDK/pubhtml) of compnents to by.

## September 8, 2017:
### Note Taker: Stephanie Lin
After the first half of lecture, we gathered in Duffield andâ€¦
* Reviewed progress made on robot
* Taught each other how to use Github/how the website is set up
* Discussed lab goals for that day

## September 1, 2017:
### Note Taker: Thinesiya
* Had Lab1: everyone attenended 
* Made progress on Lab 1 and made sure to take pictures and vedios
* Stopping Point: Assembling Robot
* Agreeded to come to Saturday Lab Hours (9/2) to make sure we finish up Lab 1
