# Lab 1
### Objective: 
The objective of this lab was to familiarize ourselves with the Arduino Uno board and IDE. We utilized digital and analog outputs, digital outputs, and writing analog PWM outputs.

### Equipment:
* 1 Arduino Uno
* 1 solderless breadboard
* 1 USB A/B cable
* 1 LED 
* 2-3 resistors (kâ„¦ range)
* 1 potentiometer
* 1 continuous rotation servo
* 1 pushbutton

## Part1: Modify the Blink Sketch
To learn about the input/output functionalities of the Uno board, we modified sample code from the blink program provided by Arduino to make an LED blink on and off every second.









## Part2: The Serial Monitor and the Analog Pins

## Part3: Analog Output

## Part4: Parallax Servos


## Part5: Assemble and Run Your Robot
Our assembled robot:
