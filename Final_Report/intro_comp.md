# Introduction 

The goal of this project was to build an intelligent physical system that could traverse a maze independently by perceiving and acting upon its environment. Our final design intended to:

* Begin on a 660 Hz tone
* Follow a grid of black lines through the maze a grid consisting of black lines
* Detect walls and IR frequency beacons (treasures)
* Display and map the maze as it progresses 
* Send a “done” signal to indicate that the robot has finished traversing the maze

Our robot, unfortunately, did not meet all the requirements of the final competition, but he sure tried really hard. He also looks the part. We are proud of it, our robo son. While he stubbornly refused to use SPI to map the maze, he was adequate in wall detection, treasure detection, and maze traversal. 

Here is a video of our pride and joy during the competition, featuring Thinesiya’s hair at some point:

Our boy never stops working. Literally. He doesn’t stop. But nonetheless, it was a wholesome learning experience in which we learned about hardware, software, & mental wear and tear due to our superb, marvelous communication skills. We like to think we grew as a team and as individuals thanks to this semester-long ~~hardship~~ team project.
