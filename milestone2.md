# Milestone2

## Objective:

## Treasure detection:

Based on the FFT library of Arduino, we developed a code that could generate “frequency spectrums” of IR signal inputs of different frequencies.

Using the Excel, we plotted the spectrum, which is essentially a distribution over 128 FFT bins. (There are 256 bins in total, but only 128 of them stores the real value) From the distribution graph we could see that IR signal with different frequencies has different peak value locations:
